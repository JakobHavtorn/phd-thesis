% - It could be interesting to discuss the remaining challenges in integrating the thesis’ range of topics into multi-stage systems for medical domains. This reflects a recurring pattern of clear intra-chapter content, and it would be interesting to discuss further the integration across thesis parts.


% Chapter 4:
% - a point for elaboration of this work would for it to be more prescriptive about how to choose the value of k in the ratio statistic, as it seems to be quite a crucial hyperparameter for practical implementation.

% Chapter 6:
% - Schematically, Figures 6.1 and 6.2 seem inconsistent and could support the text more through a consistent use of colours and labels between them.
% - The chapter doesn’t answer the pressing questions from Chapter 10: What about self-supervised methods for downstream tasks, and should one abandon ship and only focus on self-supervised methods? – this would be interesting to discuss.

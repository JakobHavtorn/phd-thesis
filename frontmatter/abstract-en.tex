% Natural language plays a key role in healthcare systems worldwide. 
% Nonetheless, despite significant progress in medicine and medical technology, the medical interview has remained largely unchanged through modern times. 
% In most settings, a single healthcare professional must act based solely on their understanding and individual experience. 
% However, expanding treatment options, strict documentation requirements, and aging populations, are stretching traditional approaches to their limits, risking medical error and the quality of care. 

% Recent advances in natural language processing enable machine learning models to actively engage in medical interviews, alleviating administrative burdens, enhancing documentation, and even providing real-time assistance in dialogue.

Natural language plays a key role in healthcare systems worldwide; yet, the medical interview process has seen little development compared to the strides made in medical technology. 
Traditionally, medical interviews are conducted by healthcare professionals who primarily rely on their individual experience to understand a situation. 
Faced with aging populations, rigorous documentation requirements, and advances in diagnostic capabilities and treatment options, this approach is costly and risks falling short, potentially compromising the accuracy and quality of medical care.

Recent advances in natural language processing enable machine learning models to actively engage in medical interviews to alleviate administrative burdens, enhance documentation, and even provide real-time assistance in dialogue. 
However, healthcare stands apart from other domains due to the high risk associated with even minor errors. Since no model is error-free, this impels pairing predictions with robust uncertainty estimates, especially in scenarios involving out-of-distribution (OOD) data, such as rare illnesses. 

This thesis sets out from the main hypothesis that unsupervised representation learning is useful for uncertainty estimation for medical tasks. 
It makes the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}[topsep=3pt, partopsep=0pt, itemsep=3pt, parsep=0pt, leftmargin=2em, label=(\alph*)] %, label=(\roman*)]
    % \item Evidence that the OOD detection capability of variational autoencoders is impeded by low-level features whose influence can be reduced by a likelihood-ratio-based score.
    \item A likelihood-ratio score for OOD detection with variational autoencoders that alleviates the proved impeding effect of low-level features.
    \item A statistical test for OOD detection combining the score and typicality tests and is applicable with likelihoods from any differentiable generative model.
    \item A benchmark of probabilistic speech representation learners and a novel method to learn hierarchical representations.
    \item An overview of unsupervised representation learning for neural speech processing and a corresponding model taxonomy.
    \item An error analysis and revised evaluation of state-of-the-art models for automated medical coding on MIMIC-III and IV datasets. 
    \item A retrospective study of audio-based stroke recognition in prehospital medical helpline calls with significant improvements over call-taker performance.
\end{enumerate}
%
In summary, this thesis addresses challenges in uncertainty estimation and representation learning for speech while exploring medical applications of machine learning.
The contributions made serve as vital components for an operational decision support system capable of handling uncertainty in the context of medical interviews that aims to enhance the quality of patient care and support more informed clinical decision-making.
% It contributes novel methods for out-of-distribution detection, probabilistic speech representation learning, and improved standards for automated medical coding, as well as clinical evidence of the potential of audio-based stroke recognition in prehospital medical helpline calls.

% Version 1: 2023-10-03

% Natural language, written or spoken, plays a pivotal role in patient interactions within healthcare systems worldwide.
% Despite significant advances in medicine and medical technology, patient interviews and general medical communication have remained largely unchanged. 
% Typically, a single healthcare professional, whether a medical helpline operator, paramedic, general practitioner, or medical coder, is tasked with understanding patient needs and taking appropriate action. 
% With aging populations, expanding treatment options, administrative burdens, and strict documentation requirements, healthcare professionals face mounting pressure in an increasingly complex environment. 
% These challenges pose risks to staff retention, quality of care, and the potential for medical errors.

% Machine learning presents an opportunity to support healthcare professionals in different medical settings, including primary care clinics and emergency services. Previous machine learning applications in healthcare have often neglected natural language, focusing on tasks involving structured data like predicting medical imaging outcomes and analyzing electronic health records. However, the use of machine learning systems to interpret natural language can alleviate the administrative and documentation burdens on healthcare professionals and help ensure critical information is not overlooked or forgotten.

% Developing machine learning systems for medical conversations is challenging due to the high-stakes nature of healthcare decisions and the complexity of unstructured language data, including speech and text. While neural network-based machine learning systems have demonstrated impressive performance in other domains, their application in healthcare can be hindered by interpretability issues and their poor ability to quantify predictive uncertainty, particularly in dynamic environments and for rare cases commonly referred to as out-of-distribution data.

% This thesis explores machine learning techniques for medical conversations, with a primary focus on uncertainty estimation and natural language processing. The first part investigates unsupervised methods for detecting out-of-distribution data and modeling speech using variational autoencoders, making the following contributions:
% %
% \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)] 
%     \item Empirical and theoretical evidence which demonstrates that low-level features dominate the likelihood estimate of hierarchical variational autoencoders and impedes detection of out-of-distribution data, as well as a novel likelihood-ratio score that requires data to be in-distribution across all feature levels.
%     % \item A novel likelihood-ratio score for unsupervised out-of-distribution detection with hierarchical variational autoencoders that requires data to be in-distribution across all feature-levels. 
%     \item A model-agnostic statistical test employing Fisher's method to combine Rao's score test and the recently introduced typicality test, applicable with likelihoods from any differentiable generative model.
%     \item Demonstrated improvements in likelihoods on speech data and latent spaces that capture information relevant for speech by using hierarchical variational autoencoders compared to shallow variants.
% \end{enumerate}
% %
% The second part of this thesis explores self"=supervised methods for speech representation and comprehension and contributes with:
% %
% \begin{enumerate}[resume, label=(\roman*)] 
%     \item A comprehensive review of self"=supervised speech representation learning that categorizes methods into contrastive, autoregressive, and generative approaches, provides a comparison of training objectives, model architectures, and downstream task performance, and discusses promising future research directions.
% \end{enumerate}
% %
% The final part centers on medical applications of machine learning and makes the following contributions:
% %
% \begin{enumerate}[resume, label=(\roman*)] 
%     \item An analysis of state-of-the-art models for automated medical coding on MIMIC-III and IV datasets. This analysis identifies suboptimal training practices, evaluation methods, and non-stratified data splits as factors contributing to poor performance. It subsequently presents a revised comparison using improved data splits and identical experimental setups shedding light on the true comparative performance of the methods.
%     \item A retrospective study demonstrating that an audio-based machine learning framework can significantly improve stroke recognition in calls made to the prehospital medical helpline, 1813, serving the Copenhagen area.
% \end{enumerate}
% %
% In summary, this thesis advances the field of machine learning in healthcare by addressing challenges in natural language processing, uncertainty estimation, and medical applications which might ultimately contribute to improved patient care and clinical decision-making.

% Discussion:
%   - Do people use SSL for uncertainty estimation? Very short literature review.

% Extra results: 
%   - Binary classification
%   - Plots of sigmoid probability for each class
% Extra results:
%   - Extreme multilabel
%   - Plots of probability for each class

% Combined discussion with Wenstrup:
%   - Discussion of overconfidence and miscalibration in predicted probabilities.
%   - Binary classification and extreme multilabel classification as two ends of the spectrum.

% The complete set of papers produced during the PhD project is listed below are classified into two categories: \textsc{primary} and \textsc{secondary}. 
\noindent Papers labeled as \textsc{primary} are central to the main theme of the project and are included as chapters of the thesis. 
Although published as part of the project, the \textsc{secondary} papers are less central to the main theme and are not included in the thesis. 
Paper \ref{enumerate: paper-review} is included in the appendix as an extended version of \ref{enumerate: paper-brief} with a focus on self"=supervised methods. 

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent The included papers have had their layout and formatting adjusted to conform to that of the thesis and any spelling and minor language errors have been corrected. The scientific content has remained unchanged.

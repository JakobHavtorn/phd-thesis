% The complete set of papers produced during the PhD project is listed below are classified into two categories: \textsc{primary} and \textsc{secondary}. 
\noindent Papers labeled as \textsc{primary} are central to the main theme of the thesis and are included as chapters of the thesis. Most have the candidate as a main author. 
The \textsc{secondary} papers are less central to the main theme, or do not have the candidate as a main author. These papers are not included in the thesis, although \ref{enumerate: paper-brief} is included in the appendix as an early version of \ref{enumerate: paper-review} with a different focus. 
%
The included papers have had their layout and formatting adjusted to conform to that of the thesis, but their substance has remained unchanged.

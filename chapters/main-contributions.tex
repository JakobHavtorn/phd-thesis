\chapter[main contribution]{Main contributions}\label{chp:main-contributions}

As previously mentioned, the chapters of the thesis are self-contained studies and therefore detail their own contributions. 
They are however written without consideration to the other chapters. 
For that reason, this chapter will provide a high-level overview of the organization of the thesis and describe its main
contributions in relation to the overall research topic.



% \cref{chp} proposes a new hierarchical latent variable model for speech inspired by the Clockwork VAE [238]. 
% The model is benchmarked against other latent variable models and autoregressive models for speech. 
% It is shown that a hierarchy of latent variables improves the likelihood of the model. 
% Finally, the latent space of the models are analyzed in terms of phonetic content.

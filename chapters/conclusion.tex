\lesstodo[inline]{Are self-supervised speech representations useful for unsupervised uncertainty estimation?}
Since the main focus within self-supervised learning has been on improving downstream task performance, very limited work, if any, has investigated self-supervised representations in terms of uncertainty estimation. 
However, in the context of medical applications where data can be abundant but labels are sparse, unsupervised uncertainty estimation is a very interesting direction for future work.
